        <p>Errick Lynne Williams, was born May 21, 1977. Growing up through humble beginnings in San Diego, where he
            excelled in football, baseball, and track. At a very young age, he had an intuitive sense that life is an
            adventure, and that the highs and lows are therefore expected (and welcomed) as part of the ride. With this
            understanding, he was able to harness the focus needed to rise to the top on the athletic field while
            weathering the inevitable storms of life.
            His performance as a running back at Patrick Henry High School led to his recruitment by the University of
            Texas, where he had a record-breaking career and was a two All-American.</p><br>
